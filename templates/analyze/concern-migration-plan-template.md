## Migration Strategy: <<STRATEGY>>

<<IF STRATEGY = STRANGLER_FIG>>

### STRANGLER_FIG Pattern

**Description**: Gradually replace the old implementation with the new one by running both side-by-side and incrementally migrating consumers.

**Why This Strategy**:
- ✅ High abstraction level detected - easy to swap implementations
- ✅ Loose coupling - minimal impact on consumers
- ✅ Low risk - can roll back individual consumers if issues arise
- ✅ Business continuity - no downtime required

**How It Works**:
1. Implement new <<TARGET_IMPLEMENTATION>> provider alongside existing <<CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION>>
2. Add feature flag to control which provider is used
3. Gradually migrate consumers from old to new provider
4. Monitor each migration wave for issues
5. Roll back individual consumers if problems detected
6. Once all consumers migrated, decommission old provider

**Key Requirements**:
- Interface/contract: <<IInterfaceName>> at <<file:line>>
- Feature flag system: <<Recommended tool/approach>>
- Monitoring: Track success rates for old vs. new provider

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks (if abstractions in place)

---

<<ELSE IF STRATEGY = ADAPTER_PATTERN>>

### ADAPTER_PATTERN

**Description**: Create an adapter layer that wraps the new implementation behind the existing interface, allowing gradual internal migration without changing consumers.

**Why This Strategy**:
- ⚠️ Medium abstraction level - some refactoring needed
- ⚠️ Moderate coupling - adapter isolates impact
- ⚠️ Medium risk - adapter tested independently before rollout

**How It Works**:
1. Create adapter interface matching current API
2. Implement adapter wrapping <<TARGET_IMPLEMENTATION>>
3. Replace current implementation with adapter (single swap)
4. Consumers unchanged (call same API, new implementation underneath)
5. Monitor adapter for performance/correctness
6. Once stable, optionally refactor consumers to use new API directly

**Key Requirements**:
- Adapter interface design
- Backward compatibility testing
- Performance benchmarking (adapter overhead)

**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks

---

<<ELSE IF STRATEGY = REFACTOR_FIRST>>

### REFACTOR_FIRST Pattern

**Description**: First refactor to introduce proper abstractions, then migrate using STRANGLER_FIG or ADAPTER_PATTERN.

**Why This Strategy**:
- ❌ Low abstraction level detected - direct migration too risky
- ❌ High coupling - must decouple before migrating
- ⚠️ Small blast radius (<20% codebase) - refactoring feasible

**How It Works**:
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Refactoring
   - Extract interfaces/contracts
   - Implement dependency injection
   - Externalize configuration
   - Wrap current implementation in provider pattern
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12)**: Migration
   - Implement new <<TARGET_IMPLEMENTATION>> provider
   - Use STRANGLER_FIG to migrate consumers
   - Monitor and validate

**Key Requirements**:
- Team buy-in for refactoring investment
- Comprehensive testing during refactoring
- No functionality changes during Phase 1 (pure refactoring)

**Timeline**: 6-12 weeks (2-4 weeks refactoring + 4-8 weeks migration)

---

<<ELSE IF STRATEGY = BIG_BANG_WITH_FEATURE_FLAGS>>

### BIG_BANG_WITH_FEATURE_FLAGS

**Description**: Complete migration in one large change, but use feature flags for gradual rollout to mitigate risk.

**Why This Strategy**:
- ❌ Low abstraction + large blast radius (>25% codebase)
- ❌ Tight coupling - piecemeal migration not feasible
- ⚠️ High risk - requires extensive testing and careful rollout

**How It Works**:
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-8)**: Implementation
   - Implement new <<TARGET_IMPLEMENTATION>> throughout codebase
   - Add feature flags at critical decision points
   - Build comprehensive test suite
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 9-16)**: Gradual Rollout
   - Week 9-10: Internal/dev team only (1% traffic)
   - Week 11-12: Beta users (10% traffic)
   - Week 13-14: Expanded rollout (50% traffic)
   - Week 15-16: Full rollout (100% traffic)
3. **Phase 3**: Monitoring and stabilization

**Key Requirements**:
- Feature flag infrastructure
- Extensive testing (unit, integration, E2E, load)
- Monitoring and alerting
- Rollback plan for each rollout phase

**Timeline**: 3-6 months

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers

**Immediate Rollback** (within minutes):
- ❌ Error rate > <<X%>> for <<Y>> minutes

- ⚠️ User complaints > <<threshold>>

### Rollback Procedures

**For STRANGLER_FIG / ADAPTER_PATTERN / BIG_BANG_WITH_FEATURE_FLAGS**:

**Step 1: Feature Flag Toggle** (< 5 minutes)
- [ ] Set feature flag `<<flagName>>` to `false` (revert to old implementation)
- [ ] Verify rollback via monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Confirm error rate returns to normal

**Step 2: Communication** (< 15 minutes)
- [ ] Notify team via <<Slack/Teams/email>>
- [ ] Update status page if user-facing
- [ ] Log incident for post-mortem

**Step 3: Root Cause Analysis** (hours-days)
- [ ] Investigate what went wrong
- [ ] Document findings
- [ ] Plan remediation

**Step 4: Retry** (when ready)
- [ ] Fix root cause
- [ ] Re-test in staging
- [ ] Retry migration with fixes

**For REFACTOR_FIRST**:

**During Refactoring Phase (Weeks 1-4)**:
- Rollback = revert Git commits (functionality unchanged)
- Run full test suite to verify
- Should be low risk (no functionality changes during refactoring)

**During Migration Phase (Weeks 5+)**:
- Same as STRANGLER_FIG rollback above
