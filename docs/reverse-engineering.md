## Overview

The **Reverse Engineering & Modernization** feature helps you analyze existing codebases to:

- 📊 **Assess current state** - Technology stack, architecture, dependencies
- ✅ **Identify strengths** - What's working well and should be preserved
- ❌ **Find weaknesses** - Technical debt, security issues, anti-patterns
- 🔄 **Plan upgrades** - LTS versions, security patches, framework migrations
- 🎯 **Make decisions** - Inline upgrade vs greenfield rewrite vs hybrid approach
- 📈 **Score feasibility** - Data-driven confidence scores for recommendations

This is particularly useful for:
- **Legacy modernization** projects
- **Technical debt** assessment
- **Security audits** and compliance
- **Migration planning** (e.g., upgrade to latest LTS)
- **Architecture reviews**

---

## When to Use This Feature

### ✅ Good Use Cases

1. **Inherited Codebase**
   - You've taken over a project and need to understand its state
   - Documentation is missing or outdated
   - You need to assess technical debt

2. **Modernization Planning**
   - Runtime/framework versions approaching EOL
   - Security vulnerabilities need addressing
   - Performance issues need investigation

3. **Migration Decision**
   - Deciding between upgrade-in-place vs rewrite
   - Need cost/risk/timeline estimates
   - Stakeholders need data-driven recommendation

4. **Compliance & Security**
   - Security audit required
   - Need to identify vulnerable dependencies
   - Preparing for compliance certification

5. **Team Onboarding**
   - New team needs architecture overview
   - Need to establish coding standards
   - Want to create project constitution from existing patterns

### ❌ Not Suitable For

- Brand new projects (use `/speckit.orchestrate` instead)
- Projects without code (idea stage)
- Non-software systems

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Analysis

```bash
# In your AI coding agent (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
/speckit.analyze-project
```

When prompted, provide:

```text
PROJECT_PATH: /path/to/your/existing/project
ANALYSIS_DEPTH: STANDARD
FOCUS_AREAS: ALL
```

### Step 2: Wait for Completion

The agent will:
- Scan your codebase
- Analyze dependencies
- Detect tech stack
- Generate comprehensive reports

**Time**: 2-4 hours for standard analysis

### Step 3: Review Reports

Analysis results saved to `.analysis/[PROJECT_NAME]-[TIMESTAMP]/`:

- `analysis-report.md` - Main comprehensive report
- `upgrade-plan.md` - Step-by-step upgrade instructions
- `recommended-constitution.md` - Suggested project principles
- `decision-matrix.md` - Comparison table for stakeholders
- `dependency-audit.json` - Machine-readable dependency data
- `metrics-summary.json` - Codebase metrics

### Step 4: Make Decision

Based on the recommendation:

**If INLINE UPGRADE**:
1. Review `upgrade-plan.md`
2. Follow phase-by-phase instructions
3. Start with immediate security patches
4. Test thoroughly at each phase

**If GREENFIELD REWRITE**:
1. Review `recommended-constitution.md`
2. Use as starting point for new project:
   ```bash
   /speckit.constitution [use recommended principles]
   /speckit.specify [describe features based on analysis]
   /speckit.plan [modern tech stack]
   ```

**If HYBRID APPROACH**:
1. Use Strangler Fig pattern
2. Extract and modernize components incrementally
3. Maintain parallel systems during migration

## Decision Making

### Decision Tree

```
START
  ↓
Is code maintainable? (Code Quality Score)
  ├─ YES (≥70) → Inline Upgrade likely
  ├─ NO (<70) → Continue evaluation
  ↓
Are dependencies healthy? (Dependency Score)
  ├─ YES (≥70) → Inline Upgrade likely
  ├─ NO (<70) → Continue evaluation
  ↓
Is architecture sound? (Architecture Score)
  ├─ YES (≥70) → Inline Upgrade likely
  ├─ NO (<70) → Continue evaluation
  ↓
Is technical debt extreme? (>60% of codebase)
  ├─ YES → Greenfield Rewrite likely
  ├─ NO → Hybrid Approach likely
  ↓
Check Business Constraints
  ├─ Time-critical? → Inline (faster)
  ├─ Budget-limited? → Inline (cheaper)
  ├─ Can maintain parallel systems? → Hybrid (safer)
  └─ Can afford downtime? → Greenfield (cleanest)
```

### Recommendation Logic

**Inline Upgrade** chosen when:
- ✅ Inline score ≥ 70

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

**1. Template-Based Analysis**

This feature currently provides comprehensive templates and methodology, but relies on the AI agent and available tools for execution. The analysis process is semi-automated rather than fully automated.

**2. Tool Dependencies**

Analysis quality depends on available tooling:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Requires npm audit (Node.js), pip-audit (Python), or similar
- **Code Metrics**: Requires cloc, tokei, scc, or similar tools
- **Security Scanning**: Best results with Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check, or similar
- **Without tools**: AI agent will provide best-effort analysis based on manual inspection

**3. Language Coverage**

While the framework supports multiple languages, depth of analysis varies:

- **Best Support**: JavaScript/Node.js, Python
- **Good Support**: Java, .NET, Ruby, PHP
- **Basic Support**: Other languages (general analysis only)

**4. Large Codebase Performance**

- **Tested on**: Projects up to 100K LOC
- **May struggle with**: Monorepos >500K LOC, deeply nested dependencies
- **Workaround**: Focus analysis on specific directories or modules

**5. Scoring Calibration**

Feasibility scores (0-100) are based on industry research and best practices, but:

- Not calibrated against specific organization's risk tolerance
- Weights are generic (customization requires manual adjustment)
- Thresholds (e.g., 80+ = highly feasible) may need adjustment for your context

**6. No Incremental Analysis**

Currently all-or-nothing analysis. Cannot resume from checkpoint if interrupted.

**7. Manual Report Assembly**

AI agent generates sections sequentially. For very large projects, may require multiple sessions with manual compilation.

**8. Security Considerations**

When analyzing untrusted codebases:

- AI agent reads code files but does not execute them
- Be cautious with: symlinks, binary files, very large files
- Recommendation: Analyze only trusted codebases or run in sandboxed environment

### Workarounds

**For Better Results**:

1. **Install analysis tools** before running:

   ```bash
   # Node.js projects
   npm install -g npm-check-updates

   # Python projects
   pip install pip-audit

   # Code metrics (any language)
   npm install -g cloc
   # or: cargo install tokei
   ```

2. **Break down large projects**:

   ```bash
   # Analyze subdirectories separately
   /speckit.analyze-project
   PROJECT_PATH: /project/backend

   /speckit.analyze-project
   PROJECT_PATH: /project/frontend
   ```

3. **Use focus areas** for faster analysis:

   ```bash
   # Security-only audit
   FOCUS_AREAS: SECURITY

   # Dependencies-only check
   FOCUS_AREAS: DEPENDENCIES
   ```

4. **Customize scoring weights** in generated reports based on your priorities

### Q: What if my project has no tests?

**A**: Analysis will flag this as critical issue and:
- Recommend adding tests before upgrade
- Lower feasibility score
- Suggest greenfield rewrite (if other factors also poor)

### Q: Can I analyze a monorepo with multiple projects?

**A**: Yes, but analyze each project separately:
```bash
/speckit.analyze-project
PROJECT_PATH: /monorepo/packages/frontend

/speckit.analyze-project
PROJECT_PATH: /monorepo/packages/backend
```

### Q: What if I disagree with the recommendation?

**A**: The AI provides data-driven recommendations, but you make the final decision. Review:
- Feasibility scores and how they're calculated
- Business constraints the AI may not know
- Team capabilities
- Risk tolerance

You can override the recommendation.

### Q: Can I re-run analysis after making changes?

**A**: Yes! Re-run to:
- Track progress
- Validate improvements
- Update recommendations

### Q: What tools does the analysis use?

**A**: Gracefully uses available tools:
- `npm audit`, `pip-audit` for vulnerabilities
- `cloc`, `tokei` for code metrics
- `eslint`, `pylint` for code quality
- Falls back to manual analysis if tools unavailable

### Q: Is my code sent anywhere?

**A**: No. Analysis runs entirely locally using your AI agent. Code never leaves your machine.

### Q: Can I customize the analysis?

**A**: Yes, focus on specific areas:
```bash
FOCUS_AREAS: SECURITY  # Security-focused audit
FOCUS_AREAS: PERFORMANCE  # Performance optimization
FOCUS_AREAS: DEPENDENCIES  # Dependency health only
```

### Q: What if analysis finds critical security issues?

**A**: Immediate actions section will list:
- CVE numbers and CVSS scores
- Affected packages
- Fix versions
- Estimated effort (usually minutes to hours)

**Prioritize these before any other work.**

### Q: Can I use this for greenfield projects?

**A**: No. For new projects, use:
```bash
/speckit.orchestrate <feature-description>
```

This is specifically for **existing** codebases.

## Next Steps

After running analysis:

1. **Review Reports** - Read `analysis-report.md` thoroughly
2. **Discuss with Team** - Share findings and recommendations
3. **Get Approval** - Present `decision-matrix.md` to stakeholders
4. **Execute Plan**:
   - Inline: Follow `upgrade-plan.md`
   - Greenfield: Use `/speckit.orchestrate` with recommended artifacts
   - Hybrid: Combine both approaches
5. **Monitor Progress** - Re-run analysis quarterly to track improvements
