# Stage 3B: Cross-Cutting Concern Migration Analysis

## Purpose

For Cross-Cutting Concern Migration (scope = B), perform deep-dive analysis of the specific concern, assess abstraction quality, calculate blast radius, and recommend migration strategy.

---

## How Context Is Provided

The CLI manages state and provides all context. **Do not read state.json directly.**

**Available template variables:**

- `{project_path}`, `{analysis_dir}`, `{scope}`, `{context}`
- `{data_dir}` - Data folder for JSON files (`{analysis_dir}/data/`)
- `{reports_dir}` - Reports folder for MD files (`{analysis_dir}/reports/`)
- Concern type, current implementation, target implementation

**Previous artifacts required (in data/ folder):**

- `{data_dir}/tech-stack.json` - Detected technologies
- `{data_dir}/category-patterns.json` - Category patterns
- `{data_dir}/deep-dive-patterns.json` - Deep analysis results

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Read Agent Instructions First

**BEFORE PROCEEDING:**

1. Check if `AGENTS.md` exists in repository root, `.specify/memory/`, or `templates/` directory
2. **IF EXISTS:** Read it in FULL - instructions are NON-NEGOTIABLE
3. Follow all AGENTS.md guidelines for the duration of this command execution

**Verification:** After reading AGENTS.md (if it exists), acknowledge with:
   "✓ Read AGENTS.md v[X.X] - Following all guidelines"

**If AGENTS.md does not exist:** Proceed with default behavior.

---

## Step 1: Abstraction Level Assessment

Evaluate how well the current implementation is abstracted from business logic.

### Scoring Criteria

**HIGH Abstraction (Score: 7-10)**:
- Concern isolated in dedicated module/package
- Clear interfaces/abstractions between concern and business logic
- Minimal direct dependencies
- Easy to swap implementations
- **Examples**:
  - Auth via `@PreAuthorize` annotations (declarative)
  - Database via repository pattern with interfaces
  - Caching via `@Cacheable` annotations

**MEDIUM Abstraction (Score: 4-6)**:
- Concern somewhat separated but with coupling
- Some direct usage in business code
- Interfaces exist but not consistently used
- Would require refactoring to swap
- **Examples**:
  - Auth checks mixed in controllers
  - Some raw SQL queries alongside ORM
  - Cache calls sprinkled in services

**LOW Abstraction (Score: 1-3)**:
- Concern tightly coupled to business logic
- No clear separation
- Direct implementation details throughout code
- Major refactoring needed to swap
- **Examples**:
  - Auth logic embedded in every method
  - Raw SQL queries everywhere
  - Direct cache library calls in business logic

### Assessment Process

1. **Identify all touch points** where concern is used
2. **Analyze coupling** - How tightly integrated is it?
3. **Check for interfaces/abstractions** - Are there clear boundaries?
4. **Evaluate swap difficulty** - How hard would migration be?

### Output

```text
Abstraction Assessment for {concern_type}:

Current Implementation: {current_implementation}
Abstraction Score: {score}/10
Abstraction Level: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH}

Touch Points Identified:
- {package/file}: {count} usages ({type of usage})
- {package/file}: {count} usages ({type of usage})
...

Abstraction Patterns Found:
- ✓ {positive pattern}
- ✗ {negative pattern}
...

Migration Complexity: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH}

```

---

## Step 2: Blast Radius Calculation

Determine how many files would be affected by migration.

### Calculation

1. **Direct Impact** - Files that directly use the concern
   - Count files with imports/references to concern
   - Example: Files importing `JwtTokenProvider`, `SecurityConfig`

2. **Indirect Impact** - Files that depend on directly impacted files
   - Files that call methods in directly impacted files
   - Depth 1 dependencies

3. **Configuration Impact** - Config files that need updates
   - Application configs
   - Build configs (dependencies)
   - Infrastructure configs (env vars, secrets)

4. **Test Impact** - Tests that need updates
   - Unit tests for affected files
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests

### Formula

```text
Total Affected Files = Direct + Indirect + Config + Tests

Blast Radius % = (Total Affected / Total Project Files) * 100

```

### Classification

- **Small** (< 10%): Localized change, low risk
- **Medium** (10-30%): Significant change, moderate risk
- **Large** (30-50%): Major change, high risk
- **Critical** (> 50%): Affects majority of codebase, very high risk

### Output

```text
Blast Radius Analysis:

Direct Impact: {count} files ({list key files})
Indirect Impact: {count} files
Configuration Impact: {count} files
Test Impact: {count} tests

Total Affected Files: {total} out of {project_total}
Blast Radius: {percentage}% ({SMALL | MEDIUM | LARGE | CRITICAL})

Risk Level: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | VERY HIGH}

```

## Step 3: Migration Strategy Recommendation

Based on abstraction level and blast radius, recommend migration approach.

### Decision Matrix

| Abstraction | Blast Radius | Recommended Strategy |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| HIGH | SMALL | **Direct Replacement** - Swap implementation directly |
| HIGH | MEDIUM/LARGE | **Phased Migration** - Gradual rollout with feature flags |
| MEDIUM | SMALL | **Refactor Then Replace** - Improve abstractions first |
| MEDIUM | MEDIUM/LARGE | **Strangler Pattern** - New implementation alongside old |
| LOW | SMALL | **Refactor Then Replace** - Extract to module first |
| LOW | MEDIUM/LARGE | **Strangler Pattern** - Long-term gradual migration |

### Migration Phases (50/30/15/5 Pattern)

**Phase 1 (50%)**: Foundation & Pilot
- Refactor abstractions if needed
- Set up new implementation infrastructure
- Migrate one pilot module/service
- Verify functionality in production
- Duration: 30-40% of total timeline

**Phase 2 (30%)**: Expansion
- Migrate 3-5 additional modules
- Parallel running (old + new)
- Monitor performance and issues
- Duration: 25-30% of total timeline

**Phase 3 (15%)**: Completion
- Migrate remaining modules
- Remove old implementation
- Clean up code
- Duration: 15-20% of total timeline

**Phase 4 (5%)**: Optimization & Cleanup
- Performance tuning
- Documentation
- Remove feature flags/toggle code
- Duration: 10-15% of total timeline

### Output

```text
Migration Strategy: {RECOMMENDED_STRATEGY}

Justification:
- Abstraction Level: {level}
- Blast Radius: {radius}
- Risk: {risk_level}

Migration Plan (4-Phase Approach):

Phase 1 - Foundation & Pilot (50%):
- Refactor {specific areas} to use interface
- Set up {target_implementation}
- Migrate {pilot module} (lowest risk)
- Deploy to staging, then 10% production
- Duration: {weeks/months}

Phase 2 - Expansion (30%):
- Migrate {module list}
- Feature flag: Enable new implementation for 50% traffic
- Monitor: Error rates, performance, user experience
- Duration: {weeks/months}

Phase 3 - Completion (15%):
- Migrate remaining {count} modules
- Ramp to 100% new implementation
- Deprecate old implementation
- Duration: {weeks/months}

Phase 4 - Cleanup (5%):
- Remove old {current_implementation} code
- Remove feature flags
- Optimize performance
- Update documentation
- Duration: {weeks/months}

Total Estimated Timeline: {total_timeline}

```

## Step 4: Risk Assessment

Identify and categorize risks.

### Risk Categories

**Technical Risks**:
- Breaking changes in new implementation
- Performance degradation
- Data migration issues
- Integration incompatibilities

**Business Risks**:
- User experience disruption
- Downtime during migration
- Training requirements
- Vendor lock-in (if switching to SaaS)

**Operational Risks**:
- Monitoring gaps during transition
- Rollback complexity
- Support burden (dual systems)
- Cost overruns

### Output

```text
Risk Assessment:

HIGH Risks:
- {risk}: {description} (Mitigation: {mitigation})
- {risk}: {description} (Mitigation: {mitigation})

MEDIUM Risks:
- {risk}: {description} (Mitigation: {mitigation})
- {risk}: {description} (Mitigation: {mitigation})

LOW Risks:
- {risk}: {description} (Mitigation: {mitigation})

```

   - E2E testing: 1 week

5. **Documentation & Training**

### Output

```text
Effort Estimation:

Development Effort:
- Abstraction Refactoring: {weeks} weeks
- New Implementation: {weeks} weeks
- Migration Execution: {weeks} weeks
- Testing: {weeks} weeks
- Documentation: {weeks} weeks

Total: {total_weeks} weeks ({total_days} person-days)
