# Stage 1B: Input Collection

## Purpose

Collect all required inputs from the user through explicit prompts. Each input requires user response before proceeding.

---

## State Management

The CLI provides all context via template variables. **Do not read state.json directly.**

**Available template variables:**
- `{project_path}`, `{scope}`, `{context}`, `{concern_type}`, `{current_impl}`, `{target_impl}`

**After collecting inputs interactively:** Pass them to the next CLI command (see "Next Substage" below).

---

## Pre-Check: CLI-Provided Values

Check if inputs were already collected via CLI interactive mode:

**Context variables to check:**

- `{project_path}` - Project path (required)
- `{scope}` - Analysis scope A or B (required)
- `{context}` - Additional context (optional, may be "$SKIP" or empty)
- `{concern_type}` - Concern type for scope B (conditional)
- `{current_impl}` - Current implementation for scope B (conditional)
- `{target_impl}` - Target implementation for scope B (conditional)

**IF** `{project_path}` is a valid path (not empty, not "$NONE") **AND** `{scope}` is "A":

- Skip all interactive input prompts below
- Use CLI-provided values directly:
  - `$PROJECT_PATH` = `{project_path}`
  - `$ANALYSIS_SCOPE` = `{scope}`
  - `$ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT` = `{context}` (use empty string if "$SKIP" or "$NONE")
- Proceed directly to "Output Summary" section

**IF** `{project_path}` is valid **AND** `{scope}` is "B" **AND** all scope-B fields are set:

- `{concern_type}` is not empty and not "$NONE"
- `{current_impl}` is not empty and not "$NONE"
- `{target_impl}` is not empty and not "$NONE"

Then skip interactive prompts and use:

- `$PROJECT_PATH` = `{project_path}`
- `$ANALYSIS_SCOPE` = `{scope}`
- `$ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT` = `{context}` (use empty string if "$SKIP" or "$NONE")
- `$CONCERN_TYPE` = `{concern_type}`
- `$CURRENT_IMPL` = `{current_impl}`
- `$TARGET_IMPL` = `{target_impl}`
- Proceed directly to "Output Summary" section

**ELSE:** Continue with interactive prompts below.

---

## Input 1: Project Path

---

[PAUSE] **[STOP: USER_INPUT_REQUIRED - PROJECT_PATH]**

Present this prompt to user EXACTLY as written:

```text
============================================================
PROJECT PATH

Please provide the absolute path to the existing project
you want to analyze.

Examples:
  Linux/Mac: /home/user/my-legacy-app
  Windows:   C:\Users\user\my-legacy-app

Your path: ___
============================================================
```

**WAIT for user response. DO NOT proceed until answered.**

---

### Validate Project Path

When user provides path:

1. Check path exists: `test -d "$PATH"` or `Test-Path "$PATH"`
2. Check path is readable
3. Check path is a directory (not a file)

**IF validation fails:**

```text
[x] Error: Invalid project path
   Reason: {path does not exist | not readable | not a directory}

Please provide a valid path: ___
```

Re-prompt until valid path provided.

**Store validated path:** `$PROJECT_PATH`

---

## Input 2: Additional Context

---

[PAUSE] **[STOP: USER_INPUT_REQUIRED - ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT]**

Present this prompt to user EXACTLY as written:

```text
============================================================
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (Optional)

Do you want to provide any additional context to help
with the analysis?

This could include:
  * Known pain points or issues
  * Business requirements or constraints
  * Deployment environment details
  * Team preferences or standards
  * Timeline or budget constraints
  * Any other relevant information

Type your context below, or type "none" to skip:
___
============================================================
```

**WAIT for user response. DO NOT proceed until answered.**

---

### Process Additional Context

- **IF** user types "none" (case-insensitive): Set `$ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT = ""`
- **ELSE**: Store user's text in `$ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT`

---

## Input 3: Analysis Scope

---

[PAUSE] **[STOP: USER_INPUT_REQUIRED - ANALYSIS_SCOPE]**

Present this prompt to user EXACTLY as written:

```text
============================================================
ANALYSIS SCOPE

What type of analysis do you need?

[A] Full Application Modernization
    -> Analyze entire codebase comprehensively
    -> Generate complete functional/technical specs
    -> Suitable for legacy app migration
    -> Outputs: analysis-report, functional-spec,
               technical-spec, stage-prompts

[B] Cross-Cutting Concern Migration
    -> Analyze entire application context FIRST
    -> THEN deep-dive into specific concern
    -> Assess abstraction quality for migration
    -> Suitable for: auth migration, database swap,
                    caching layer, observability, etc.
    -> Outputs: analysis-report, abstraction-assessment,
               concern-migration-plan, rollback-procedure

Your choice [A/B]: ___
============================================================
```

**WAIT for user response. DO NOT proceed until answered.**

---

### Validate Analysis Scope

**IF** user response is NOT "A" or "B" (case-insensitive):

```text
[x] Invalid selection. Please choose [A] or [B].

Your choice [A/B]: ___
```

Re-prompt until valid choice received.

**Store validated choice:** `$ANALYSIS_SCOPE` (uppercase: "A" or "B")

---

## Input 4: Concern Details (Conditional)

**ONLY IF** `$ANALYSIS_SCOPE = "B"`:

---

[PAUSE] **[STOP: USER_INPUT_REQUIRED - CONCERN_DETAILS]**

Present these prompts to user EXACTLY as written:

```text
============================================================
CONCERN DETAILS

You selected Cross-Cutting Concern Migration.
Please provide details about the concern:

1. CONCERN TYPE
   Which cross-cutting concern do you want to migrate?

   Examples:
     * Authentication/Authorization
     * Database/ORM Layer
     * Caching Layer
     * Message Bus/Queue
     * Resilience/Fault Tolerance
     * Logging/Observability
     * API Gateway/Routing
     * File Storage/CDN
     * Deployment/Infrastructure

   Your concern type: ___

2. CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
   What is currently used?
   (Will be detected from code, but specify if known)

   Examples: "Custom JWT with bcrypt", "Oracle 11g", "Memcached 1.4"

   Current implementation: ___

3. TARGET IMPLEMENTATION
   What do you want to migrate to?

   Examples: "Okta", "PostgreSQL 15 with Prisma", "Redis 7.x", "AWS"

   Target implementation: ___
============================================================
```

**WAIT for ALL THREE responses. DO NOT proceed until all answered.**

---

### Store Concern Details

- `$CONCERN_TYPE` = User's concern type
- `$CURRENT_IMPL` = Current implementation
- `$TARGET_IMPL` = Target implementation

**IF** `$ANALYSIS_SCOPE = "A"`: Set all three to empty strings.

---

## Output Summary

```text
===========================================================
  SUBSTAGE COMPLETE: 01b-input-collection

  Collected Inputs:
    Project Path: {$PROJECT_PATH}
    Analysis Scope: {A - Full Application | B - Cross-Cutting}
    Additional Context: {provided | none}
    {IF scope=B: Concern: {$CONCERN_TYPE} ({$CURRENT_IMPL} -> {$TARGET_IMPL})}

  Analysis Folder: {analysis_dir}

  Next: Run speckitadv analyze-project
===========================================================
```

## Next Substage

**IF inputs were collected interactively (not from CLI):**

Pass collected inputs to the CLI to persist to state.json:

```bash
# For Scope A:
speckitadv analyze-project --path="$PROJECT_PATH" --scope=A --context="$ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT"

# For Scope B:
speckitadv analyze-project --path="$PROJECT_PATH" --scope=B --context="$ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT" --concern-type="$CONCERN_TYPE" --current-impl="$CURRENT_IMPL" --target-impl="$TARGET_IMPL"
```

**IF inputs were pre-provided via CLI (template variables were set):**

Run: `speckitadv analyze-project`

The CLI will auto-detect the current stage and emit the next prompt.
