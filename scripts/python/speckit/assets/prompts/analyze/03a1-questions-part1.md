# [NO] DO NOT CREATE FILES

**CRITICAL: This substage does NOT create any files.**

- [x] NO `stage9-chunk1.md`
- [x] NO `stage9.md`
- [x] NO markdown files in the analysis directory
- [x] NO intermediate output files of any kind

**Questions are asked directly in the conversation.** Responses are stored via CLI command at the end.

# Stage 3A-1: Modernization Questions (Part 1)

## Purpose

Ask the first 5 modernization questions to understand the user's target technology preferences. Each question MUST be asked exactly as written and MUST wait for user response.

---

## How Context Is Provided

The CLI manages state and provides all context. **Do not read state.json directly.**

Values available in this prompt (already substituted by CLI):
- Project path, analysis directory, scope (must be "A"), context

---

## Question Protocol

**Rules for asking questions:**

1. Present EACH question EXACTLY as written below
2. Show ALL options - do not remove or combine choices
3. Wait for user response before proceeding to next question
4. Validate response matches expected format
5. Record exact user response

**Response Handling:**
- If user provides valid option -> Record and proceed
- If user provides invalid response -> Re-prompt with clarification
- If user requests clarification -> Provide context, then re-ask
- If user types "skip" -> Record as "skip" (use existing/default)

---

## Storing Preferences

After collecting responses for Q1-Q5, store ALL preferences using ONE CLI command:

```bash
speckitadv update-preferences '{"q1_language": {"value": "..."}, "q2_database": {"value": "..."}, ...}'
```

DO NOT store preferences after each question. Collect all 5, then store once at the end.
