# [NO] DO NOT CREATE FILES

**CRITICAL: This substage does NOT create any files.**

- [x] NO `stage9-chunk2.md`
- [x] NO `stage9.md`
- [x] NO markdown files in the analysis directory
- [x] NO intermediate output files of any kind

**Questions are asked directly in the conversation.** Responses are stored via CLI command at the end.

# Stage 3A-2: Modernization Questions (Part 2)

## Purpose

Ask questions 6-10 to complete the modernization preferences. These cover infrastructure as code, containerization, observability, security, and testing.

---

## How Context Is Provided

The CLI manages state and provides all context. **Do not read state.json directly.**

Values available (already substituted by CLI):
- Project path, analysis directory, scope, context
- Q1-Q5 responses are in artifacts from previous stage

---

## Storing Preferences

After collecting responses for Q6-Q10, store ALL preferences using ONE CLI command:

```bash
speckitadv update-preferences '{"q6_iac": {"value": "..."}, "q7_containerization": {"value": "..."}, ...}'
```

DO NOT store preferences after each question. Collect all 5, then store once at the end.

---

    "q3_message_bus": "{q3_message_bus.value}",
    "q4_package_manager": "{q4_package_manager.value}",
    "q5_deployment": "{q5_deployment.value}",
    "q6_iac": "{q6_iac.value}",
    "q7_containerization": "{q7_containerization.value}",
    "q8_observability": {
      "metrics": "{q8 metrics}",
      "logging": "{q8 logging}",
      "tracing": "{q8 tracing}"
    },
    "q9_security": "{q9_security.value}",
    "q10_testing": {
      "strategy": "{q10_testing.value}",
      "coverage_target": "{q10_testing.coverage_target}"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Persist Preferences

After collecting all 10 responses, persist them to state.json using the CLI:

```bash
speckitadv update-preferences '{"q1_language": {"value": "{q1 value}"}, "q2_database": {"value": "{q2 value}"}, "q3_message_bus": {"value": "{q3 value}"}, "q4_package_manager": {"value": "{q4 value}"}, "q5_deployment": {"value": "{q5 value}"}, "q6_iac": {"value": "{q6 value}"}, "q7_containerization": {"value": "{q7 value}"}, "q8_observability": {"value": {"metrics": "{q8 metrics}", "logging": "{q8 logging}", "tracing": "{q8 tracing}"}}, "q9_security": {"value": "{q9 value}"}, "q10_testing": {"value": "{q10 strategy}", "coverage_target": "{q10 coverage}"}}'
```

This stores all preferences in `{analysis_dir}/state.json` under the `modernization_preferences` field.
