# Stage 5: Complete

## Purpose

Validate implementation and report completion.

---

## Step 1: Completion Validation

**CRITICAL: Verify tasks.md is fully updated before proceeding**

**Task Verification:**

1. Read `{feature_dir}/tasks.md`
2. Count tasks: `grep -c '\- \[ \]' tasks.md` should return 0
3. If ANY tasks show `- [ ]`, they are incomplete - go back to Stage 4
4. Verify task count matches expected total

**Checklist:**

- [ ] ALL tasks in tasks.md show `[X]` (no `[ ]` remaining)
- [ ] Implementation matches specification
- [ ] Tests pass and coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Implementation follows technical plan
- [ ] Ignore files properly configured

---

## Step 2: Generate Summary

```markdown
# Implementation Summary

**Feature**: {{feature_name}}
**Branch**: {{branch}}

## Task Completion

| Phase | Tasks | Completed |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Setup | [N] | [N] |
| Foundational | [N] | [N] |
| US1 | [N] | [N] |
| US2 | [N] | [N] |
| Polish | [N] | [N] |
| **Total** | [N] | [N] |

## Artifacts Created

- [list of created files]

## Test Status

- Unit tests: [passing/failing]
- Integration tests: [passing/failing]
- Coverage: [X]%
```

---

## Step 3: Report Completion

```text

[ok] Implementation complete

Tasks: [N]/[N] completed
Tests: [status]
Files created: [N]

Next steps:
  1. Review code changes
  2. Run full test suite
  3. Create pull request

Suggested commit:
  git add . && git commit -m "feat: implement {{feature_name}}"
```

## Error Recovery Notes

**If stopped mid-phase:**
- Check tasks.md for [X] vs [ ]
- Resume from first unchecked task

**If task failed:**
- Fix error in code
- Keep task [ ] until fixed
- Retry and mark [X] on success

**If tests failing:**
- Do NOT mark [X] if tests fail
- Fix implementation or tests
- Re-run until passing

## WORKFLOW COMPLETE

Implementation is done. Ready for code review.
